# Personal Reflection

As a second year intern, I continued to grow my skillset in the technical world. Last year, I primarily focused on machine learning and data science related projects, more specifically Kaggle Mack and Data Science using R Studio. Although I gained new insight into these topics, I had prior experience with these topics and I wanted to learn more about cybersecurity.

My goal for the internship this year was to dive deeper into cybersecurity while still programming. The topic I chose to learn was Reverse Engineering, and that was done through the File Format Reverse Engineering project. This project taught me to look at specific patterns and how those patterns can be used to decrypt or decode the data. One example is learning that repeated phrases most often means that a XOR cipher was used. After decoding the file, I programmed it to automate the process.

In addition to Reverse Engineering, I am glad that I learned more about packet and network analysis through the group project. Given the Wireshark capture, I learned to follow the TCP stream and from there got the stone. 

Overall, this internship was a very fulfilling experience. As I reflect back, I was more involved in the individual and group projects, and I feel that I learned a lot more this summer. Next summer, I hope to continue learning Reverse Engineering, especially through decompilers, and compete in more CTF-type challenges.
