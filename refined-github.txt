Setting up Chrome and Github to download individual folders

1. Install the Refined Github browser extension. Links for the Chrome and FFX extensions are here https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github.

2. Create a github personal access token by following the instructions here and then copy the token: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

3. In the pandora repo, navigate to the folder you want to download. 

4. Click the "..." button. It's on the right-hand side, above the block containing the file list. It should offer you the option to Download Directory.

5. This will take you a page with the white text "download-direectory.github.io". Don't worry if it doesn't do anything. We still need to add the token you created and copied earlier.

6. Click the "token" text and paste your token in the box. Press Enter. 

7. Now go back to pandora and click the "..." button again to download a directory. This time, it should zip up the directory of files and download it automatically.
